    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Lightly whisk 2 large eggs, 6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk and a pinch of salt together until the mixture has just one consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add a knob of butter and let it melt. Donâ€™t allow the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting and folding it over from the bottom of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat and leave for a moment to finish cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Give a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay.
